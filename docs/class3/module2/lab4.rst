Lab 2.4: Miscellaneous
----------------------
Connect as **paula**.
Open ``site42.example.com``.

1. **Page Load Time** is dependent on CSPM (Client side Perf Monitoring javascript injection).

An HTTP response is eligible for CSPM injection under the following conditions:

- The HTTP content is not compressed.
- The HTTP content-type is text/html.
- The HTTP content contains an HTML <head> tag.

Navigation Timing is currently supported by the following browsers:

- Internet Explorer 9 and later
- Mozilla Firefox 4 and later
- Chrome 10 and later

For a response containing the CSPM injection to generate results, the client browser must support the Navigation Timing API (window.performance.timing).

In order to get the page load time, there are 2 things:
- ``Page Load Time`` parameter in the HTTP Analytics profile attached to the virtual server needs to be enabled
- The ``Request Header Erase`` needs to be set to ``Accept-Encoding``

In order to test it quickly, let's manually set in the HTTP profile attached to ``site42.example.com`` on the BIG-IP ``SEA-vBIGIP01.termmarc.com``

.. note :: Other way could be to create a clone of a default template and change the parameter Request Header Erase within the template. Note we cannot modify the default built-in templates.

Launch a RDP session to have access to the vCenter webui (vCenter runs as an instance
in our ESXi). To do this, in your UDF deployment, click on the *Access* button
of the *ESXi 6.5.0 + vCenter* system and select *VCENTER THROUGH WIN7*

Open Chrome and navigate on the website http://site42.example.com. If you open the developer tools in the browser (ctrl+shift+i), you can see the F5 CSPM javascript added to the page.

Go back on the BIG-IQ, expand the right-edge of the analytics pane and check you can see now the Page Load Time.

2. Differences when Enhanced Analytics are enabled or disable on the HTTP Analytics profile
Login to BIG-IP, go to ``SEA-vBIGIP01.termmarc.com`` BIG-IP, Local Traffic > Profiles > Analytics > HTTP Analytics.

3. Compare two or more items in the detailed right hand panel. i.e. compare pool members and URLs.
