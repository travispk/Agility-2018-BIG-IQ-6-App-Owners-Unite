Lab 2.4: Miscellaneous

Connect as **paula** with password of **paula**
Open ``site42.example.com``.

**Page Load Time** is dependent on CSPM (Client side Perf Monitoring javascript injection).

An HTTP response is eligible for CSPM injection under the following conditions:

- The HTTP content is not compressed.
- The HTTP content-type is text/html.
- The HTTP content contains an HTML <head> tag.

Navigation Timing is currently supported by the following browsers:

- Internet Explorer 9 and later
- Mozilla Firefox 4 and later
- Chrome 10 and later

For a response containing the CSPM injection to generate results, the client browser must support the Navigation Timing API (window.performance.timing).

In order to get the page load time, there are 2 things:
- ``Page Load Time`` parameter in the HTTP Analytics profile attached to the virtual server needs to be enabled
- The ``Request Header Erase`` needs to be set to ``Accept-Encoding``

In order to test it quickly, let's manually set in the HTTP profile attached to ``site42.example.com`` on the BIG-IP ``SEA-vBIGIP01.termmarc.com``

.. note :: Other way could be to create a clone of a default template and change the parameter Request Header Erase within the template. Note we cannot modify the default built-in templates.

Launch a RDP session to have access to the vCenter webui (vCenter runs as an instance
in our ESXi). To do this, in your UDF deployment, click on the *Access* button
of the *ESXi 6.5.0 + vCenter* system and select *VCENTER THROUGH WIN7*

Open Chrome and navigate on the website http://site42.example.com. If you open the developer tools in the browser (ctrl+shift+i), you can see the F5 CSPM javascript added to the page.

Go back on the BIG-IQ, expand the right-edge of the analytics pane and check you can see now the Page Load Time.
